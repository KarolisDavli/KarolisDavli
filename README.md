### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Im front end web developer and designer.

I have over two years experience building and designing web projects. I work efficiently with  
- HMTL  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
At the moment I am focusing on modern Javascript. Check my most recent project [~~Calculator~~](https://github.com/karolisdavli/calculator) [Digital Library](https://github.com/karolisdavli/library).

I believe there is always things to learn, especially in web development.  
I am currently learning more advanced technologies such as  
- React.js  
- Node.js  
- npm  
- Webpack 
- and more with help from open source full stack curriculum - [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
